1. Dependencies
===============

Logstalgia requires the following libraries to compile (package names may vary):

    SDL 1.2 (libsdl1.2-dev)
    SDL Image 1.2 (libsdl-image1.2-dev)
    PCRE3 (libpcre3-dev)
    Freetype 2 (libfreetype6-dev)
    GLEW (libglew-dev)
    GLM (libglm-dev) >= 0.9.3
    Boost >= 1.46 (libboost-dev)
    PNG (libpng12-dev)

2. Building
===========

GCC 4.7 or greater is recommended.

If you got the source directly from the Logstalgia.git repository, you will
first need to run autogen.sh which will generate the configure script and
initialize and update the submodules.

    ./autogen.sh

Building on Linux/Mac OS:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

Building on Windows:

On Windows I recommend compiling the project file logstalgia.win32.cbp
for the Code Blocks IDE (www.codeblocks.org).

A pre-built version for Windows is normally available from the homepage.

Logstalgia expects SDL to have been built with the NO_STDIO_REDIRECT flag.

3. Configure Options
====================

By default Logstalgia will install some GNU FreeFont TTF Fonts on your system.

If you already have these fonts installed, you can configure Logstalgia to use
these instead:

    ./configure --enable-ttf-font-dir=/path/to/freefont/
