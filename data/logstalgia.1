.TH Logstalgia 1
.SH NAME
Logstalgia -  a web server access log visualization tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fIlogstalgia\fR
[\-f] [\-WIDTHxHEIGHT] [options] logfile
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIlogstalgia\fR
replays or streams a standard web access log (eg access.log) as a retro arcade game-like simulation.
.SH REQUIREMENTS
\fIlogstalgia\fR's display is rendered using OpenGL and requires a 3D accelerated video card to run.

As \fIlogstalgia\fR is designed to playback logs in real time you will need a log from a fairly busy webserver to achieve interesting results (eg 100s of requests each minute).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-f\fR
Fullscreen.
.TP
\fB\-WIDTHxHEIGHT\fR
Set the window size. If \-f is also supplied, will attempt to set the video mode to this also.
.TP
\fB\-b, \-\-background\fR
Background colour in hex.
.TP
\fB\-x  \-\-full\-hostnames\fR
Show full request ip/hostname.
.TP
\fB\-s, \-\-speed\fR
Simulation speed. Defaults to 1 (1 second-per-second).
.TP
\fB\-u, \-\-update\-rate\fR
Page Summary update speed. Defaults to 5 (5 seconds).
.TP
\fB\-g name,regex,percent[,colour]\fR
Urls matching the given regex will appear under a new section with the given name using the given percentage of the screen. Colour may optionally be supplied in the common hexadecimal format (eg FF0000 for red)

If no groups are supplied the default groups are Images (image files), CSS (.css files) and Scripts (.js files).

If there is enough space remaining a catch-all group of Misc will appear as the last group.
.TP
\fB\-\-paddle\-mode MODE\fR
Paddle mode (pid, vhost, single).

\fBvhost\fR  \- seperate paddle for each virtual host in the log file.

\fBpid\fR    \- seperate paddle for each process id in the log file.

\fBsingle\fR \- single paddle (the default).
.TP
\fB\-\-sync\fR
Begin with the next entry received (implies STDIN).
.TP
\fB\-\-start\-position POSITION\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-stop\-position POSITION\fR
Stop at some position.
.TP
\fB\-\-no\-bounce\fR
No bouncing.
.TP
\fB\-\-hide\-response\-code\fR

.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-progress\fR
Disable the progress bar.
.TP
\fB\-\-disable\-glow\fR
Disable the glow effect.
.TP
\fB\-\-glow\-duration\fR
Duration of the glow (between 0.0 and 1.0).
.TP
\fB\-\-glow\-multiplier\fR
Adjust the amount of glow.
.TP
\fB\-\-glow\-intensity\fR
Intensity of the glow.
.TP
\fB\-\-output\-ppm\-stream FILE\fR
Write frames as PPM to a file ('\-' for STDOUT).
.TP
\fB\-\-output\-framerate FPS\fR
Framerate of output (used with \-\-output\-ppm\-stream).
.TP
\fBlogfile\fR
The path to the access log file to read or '\-' if you wish to supply log entries via STDIN.

.SH EXAMPLES

Watch an example Apache access.log using the default settings:

.ti 10
\fIlogstalgia\fR SDLAPP_RESOURCE_DIR/example.log

Watch the live Apache access.log, starting from the most recent batch of entries in the log (requires tail). Note than '\-' at the end is required for
\fIlogstalgia\fR
to know it needs to read from STDIN:

.ti 10
tail \-f /var/log/apache2/access.log | \fIlogstalgia\fR \-

To follow the log in real time, use the \-\-sync option. This will start reading from the next entry received on STDIN:

.ti 10
tail \-f /var/log/apache2/access.log | \fIlogstalgia\fR \-\-sync

Watch a remote Apache access.log via ssh. The '\-g' option is used here to group together URLs requested containing the string '/adclick.php' under the heading 'Ad Clicks':

.ti 10
ssh user@yourserver.com tail \-f /var/log/apache2/access.log | \fIlogstalgia\fR \-g "Ad Clicks,/adclick.php,30" -

.SH SUPPORTED APACHE LOG FORMATS

Logstalgia supports the following widely used Apache log formats:

.ti 10
Common Log Format (CLF)
.ti 10
    "%h %l %u %t \\"%r\\" %\>s %b"

.ti 10
Common Log Format with Virtual Host
.ti 10
    "%v %h %l %u %t \\"%r\\" %\>s %b"

.ti 10
NCSA extended/combined log format
.ti 10
    "%h %l %u %t \\"%r\\" %\>s %b \\"%{Referer}i\\" \\"%{User-agent}i\\""

.ti 10
NCSA extended/combined log format with Virtual Host
.ti 10
    "%v %h %l %u %t \\"%r\\" %\>s %b \\"%{Referer}i\\" \\"%{User-agent}i\\""

Additionally, the process id (%P) or some other identifier, may be included as the last field for use with '\-\-paddle\-mode pid', where each pid will have a seperate paddle.

.SH CUSTOM LOG FORMAT

Logstalgia now supports a pipe ('|') delimited custom log file format:

.ti 10
timestamp       - unix timestamp of the request date.
.ti 10
hostname        - hostname of the request
.ti 10
path            - path requested
.ti 10
response_code   - the response code from the webserver (eg 200)
.ti 10
response_size   - the size of the response in bytes

The following are optional:

.ti 10
success         - 1 or 0 to indicate if successful
.ti 10
response_colour - response colour in hexidecial (#FFFFFF) format
.ti 10
referrer url    - the referrer url
.ti 10
user agent      - the user agent
.ti 10
virtual host    - the virtual host (to use with \-\-paddle-mode vhost)
.ti 10
pid             - process id or some other identifier for the paddle (to use with \-\-paddle-mode pid)

If success or response_colour are not provided, they will be derived from the response_code using the normal HTTP conventions (code < 400 = success).

.SH RECORDING VIDEOS

See the guide on the homepage for examples of recording videos with Logstalgia:

.ti 10
http://code.google.com/p/logstalgia/wiki/Videos

.SH INTERFACE
The time shown in the top left of the screen is set initially from the first log entry read and is incremented according to the simulation speed (\-s).

The counter in the bottom right hand corner shows the number of requests displayed since the start of the current session.

Pressing space at any time will pause/unpause the simulation. While paused you may use the mouse to inspect the detail of individual requests.

Interactive keyboard commands:
.sp
.ti 10
(q) Debug Information
.ti 10
(c) Displays Logstalgia logo
.ti 10
(n) Jump forward in time to next log entry.
.ti 10
(+-) Adjust simulation speed.
.ti 10
(<>) Adjust time scale.
.ti 10
(ESC) Quit
